•I’m a graduate with strong background in statistics, so in the project I spent most of my time figuring out a good models. I didn’t have any experiences in developing web server, so I just started to learn flask on this Monday and created a very rough web server.  The server achieve the function of giving suggestions on whatever I typed in, but I still haven’t figured out how to invoke the request through every keystroke. The result only shows after each time the ‘enter’ key is pressed. I believe there is better solution with Java Script, which I’m not quite familiar with. Since the time is a bit of limited, I temporarily haven’t solve this.


How to use my autocomplete server:
•In command line, cd to the folder path 
•Run the app by command line: $python3 app.py
    If it works properly, it will return:
    Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
•Type in whatever you like in the textbox, for instance: "How can I",press enter
    The server will return you a list of suggested words or sentences
